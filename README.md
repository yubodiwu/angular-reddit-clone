# angular-reddit-clone
A clone of the Reddit Front page using real-time data and AngularJS

Just open the index.html file and see a very basic rendering of the Reddit front page. Next steps in this project are making viewing messages on a post possible and getting upvote and downvote functionality (just for kicks, it won't affect the actual Reddit front page).
